# Module-2-Challenge

## Description

Advance Portfolio Challenge, or Module 2's Challenge, is to create a web application from scratch. Specifically, build a portfolio page that can be used as the course progresses, as well as used to showcase our skills when applying for full/part time work. This will be accomplished by adding samples of my work, adding my name/avatar/contract information, ulitizing navigation bars and references, adding adaptable viewing screens, and adding deployable applications. This challenge will test our ability to utilize flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.
